I have brokerage account with Vanguard. I use it to save up for a car in 10-15 years. It's a longer-term savings goal, so I didn't want to put it in a high-yield savings account. A brokerage account is perfect for financial goals that you want to meet in 10 years or so, but still want to be able to access it before traditional retirement age. 

# Brokerage accounts make sense ...
... if you want to invest your extra cash and you don't need them for a couple of years. If you sell the investment within a year, you will be subject to short term capital gains tax. This is equal to your ordinary income tax. If you hold your investments for longer than a year, they will be subject to long term capital gains tax. Long term capital gains tax is favorable since it's 0% for withdrawals up to $80,800 in 2021 for couples filing their taxes as married filing jointly. There are also no withdrawal penalties as with retirement accounts, and you can contribute as much as you want to. 

# Before you open that brokerage account ...
... you want to make sure you have your finances in order. This means 3-6 months of emergency fund savings in a high-yield savings account; no consumer debt (e.g. credit cards); funding your 401K to take advantage of any company match (which leads to 100% return of your investment!); and fully contributing to an IRA, be it traditional or Roth. Then start thinking about investing in a brokerage account.

# Foreign nationals and investing
If you are a foreign national in the US, brokerage accounts might make more sense than IRAs. You'll have an easier access to your investments since there are no withdrawal penalties or strict age rules. Please be aware of potential taxes you will need to pay once you withdraw (either to the US or your home country) and on dividend income. 

Perform a deeper analysis about whether it makes sense to invest in brokerage or tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs. This of course, depends if you plan on working in and immigrating to the US. Check out this podcast by Personal Finance for PhDs about investing as an international student, for example. 

# How to open a brokerage account
If you invest with Vanguard or Fidelity, this is easy-peasy. Log in to your
account, click on "open account" and choose "brokerage account". The next step is to fund the account. This can be done using bank transfers, for example. The money will be transferred to your core account. After it's transferred in, which might take a day or two, you need to then invest the money.

# What to invest in
There's an issue with brokerage accounts: they're taxable. So, there are investments that are better in a tax-advantaged account vs a brokerage account. See this article on Bogleheads about tax efficient fund placement. 

I've invested in VTSAX, which has an expense ratio of 0.04%. You can also invest in individual stocks, bonds, and other securities. But, I like the diversification that comes with the index funds listed above. I also choose to reinvest my dividends. 

With that said, happy investing!
