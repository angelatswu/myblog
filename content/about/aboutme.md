Welcome to my blog! My name is Angela Wu. I'm a mechanical engineering PhD graduate from the University of Michigan. I recently finished a two-year postdoc at Sandia National Labs, and now work as a research engineer at Convergent Science in Michigan. My husband and I are proud dog parents to a pug named Oskar.

My main focus on this blog is the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) movement. My interest in personal finance and investing began during my undergraduate studies, when I first started budgeting with YNAB to make ends meet with my minimum wage job. I delved deeper into investing after reading “Bogleheads Guide to Investing”. Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences and knowledge on budgeting, saving, investing, and all aspects of personal finance.

In addition to blogging, I also offer financial coaching services. I enjoy helping others and teaching them how to budget effectively, pay off debt, and build wealth through savings and investing. If you’re interested in working together, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at angela.phdonfire@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
