Welcome to my blog! My name is Angela. I'm a mechanical engineering PhD graduate from the University of Michigan. I recently finished a two-year postdoc at Sandia National Labs, and now work as a research engineer in Michigan. My husband and I are proud dog parents to a pug named Oskar.

I focus on personal finance on this blog, but sometimes, when inspiration strikes, I also write about other topics. I follow the FIRE (Financial Independent Retire Early) movement, hence the name of my blog, PhD on FIRE. Coincidently, my research area is also on combustion. 

I also enjoy providing financial coaching services to others. I like teaching people how to budget effectively, pay off debt, and meet their financial goals. If you’re interested in working together, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at angela.phdonfire@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
